* Corwin's Version
This is a generic lookup table used for calculating difficulty as a
single roll of two six-sided dice.  The base difficulty is the dungeon
level unless otherwise noted (e.g. a difficulty specified for selected
baddie would generally govern).

** Difficulty

| -10 | Boxcars => Boxcars       | bad     |
|  -9 | Bx => Avoid Even         |         |
|  -8 | Bx => Avoid D+3+5+7      |         |
|  -7 | Bx => Avoid D+7          |         |
|  -6 | Bx => Avoid D+3+5        |         |
|  -5 | Bx => Avoid D            |         |
|  -4 | Bx => Avoid LowD         |         |
|  -3 | Bx => Avoid Sn           |         |
|  -2 | Boxcars                  |         |
|  -1 | High-Doubles             |         |
|   0 | Doubles                  | even-up |
|   1 | D+11                     |         |
|   2 | D+9+11                   |         |
|   3 | D+7                      |         |

|   5 | D+7+9+11                 |         |
|   6 | Even                     |         |
|   7 | Avoid D+3+5+7+11         |         |
|   8 | Avoid D+7                |         |
|  10 | Avoid D                  |         |
