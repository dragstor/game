This set of tables pick a specific Relic found in treasure.  In can be
use for normal chamber and other types of encounters (e.g. beach,
tower, corridor).

 + Calculate (base-index) as the index of the encounter after adding any
   adjustment from the baddie, events, etc.
 + Dungeon Master rolls 1d re-rolling and adding any six to create
   (adjusted-index)
 + Use the final die roll to select a Type
 + Players roll into starting tables according the rules given

** Type:
| 1 | Armor         |
| 2 | Shields       |
| 3 | Items         |
| 4 | Relic Power   |
| 5 | Weapons       |
| 6 | Add & Re-roll |

** Armor

 + Players roll 1d (re-rolling 6s) into the table according the final
   adjusted index from the games master.  Effectively, we are
   graduating the increase in base damage with an increased
   possibility of the armor having additional properties ("effects").
 + Players roll to trigger each possible effect, forms generally
   following the Saving Throw difficulty table.
 + See the Effects table for individual descriptions.

|      ix | item                         | On    | Effect     | On  | Effect     | On  | Effect     |
|---------+------------------------------+-------+------------+-----+------------+-----+------------|
|    1-30 | plate, 10 + floor(ix *.25)   | Bx-Bx | Reflect/D  |     |            |     |            |
|   31-50 | plate, 5 + floor(ix * .5)    | Bx    | Regen(1d)  |     |            |     |            |
|   51-70 | plate, -15 + floor(ix * .5)  | D     | Regen(2d)  | Bx  | Regen(D)   |     |            |
|   71-80 | plate, -10 + floor(ix * .5)  | Even  | Regen(2d)  | Bx  | Reflect/D  |     |            |
|   81-90 | plate, -20 + floor(ix * .5)  | D     | Regen(3d)  | HiD | Regen(D)   | Bx  | Defect(D)  |
|  91-100 | plate, -15 + floor(ix * .5)  | Even  | Regen(3d)  | HiD | Regen(D)   | Bx  | Reflect(D) |
| 101-120 | plate, -30 + floor(ix * .75) | D     | Regen(DoD) | D   | Regen(D+7) | HiD | Deflect(D) |
|    121- | plate, -40 + floor(ix * .75) | Even  | Regen(D+7) | D+7 | Deflect(D) | D   | Reflect(D) |

** Shields

 + Same general idea as Armor

| ix | item | On | Effect | On | Effect | On | Effect |
|----+------+----+--------+----+--------+----+--------|
|    |      |    |        |    |        |    |        |

** Items

 + Players roll 1d down followed by 1d across into the first table.
 + Asterisks mark cells which advance the player to the next table,
   into which they must roll again in the same manner as before.
 + The Item Descriptions table indexes items from all tables.
 + TODO: process/legend for
   charge/perishable/per-(decent|battle|evening) quantities or just
   inline this with each item?

** Relic Power

Relic Power allows priests possessing their holy symbols to, in some
circumstances to wit generally during combat, alter the natural roll
of player or Games Masters dice rolls.  Generally rolls related to
treasure are exempt from Relic Power as typically are those of NPCs.

 + TODO: write indexed formula using dungeon level and DM adjusted
   index + player 1d (re-rolling 6)

** Weapons

Weapon assignment is similar to armor but also graduates increased
chance of throwable and multi-attack.

 + TODO: write the relic:weapons table

** Effects

This section describes effects applied to armor and shields.  These
generally operate after the battle during healing phase.
