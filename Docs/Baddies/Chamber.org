* Chamber Baddies

+ This table is the Main baddies table used in chambhers and "normal" encounters
+ To find the starting table use (Dungeon level) + (number of squares of chamber - 1)
+ (Therefor a 10x10 on level 1 is (1) + (1-1) = 1 and a 10x20 on level 3 is (3) + (2-1) = 4)
+ half squares of chamber are half tables (start on the B table instead of the A Table)

+ Roll 1D6 into the starting table, 1-5 select baddie by ID, 6 reroll on the next table

*** Informational note
+ Tables are divided into multiple parts for several reasons.
+ There is a variety of baddies that have a similar difficulty and can appear in the same part of the dungeon.
+ The table number is the number of treasure rolls after the battle, so we can have battles of comparable difficulty give the same ammount of treasure
+ The table letter should generally progress from less difficult to more difficult encounters, and can influence the quality of the treasure
