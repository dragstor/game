;;; Commentary:

;;  A very simple ETL tool for org.

;; We define a batch process in terms of a number of steps each
;; represented by a function returning the next step, if any.

;;  Support "tables" (or maybe another org elemnt type bound to
;;  dm-table-element) in terms of a set functions to:
;;   - Extract e.g. read from the source document
;;   - Transform, e.g. create a result or side effect from source
;;   - Load e.g. write the sorce, back to the document or elsewhere

;;  As any implicit cooperation amung these methods is left to their
;;  implemention, this module simple provides an API for driving the
;;  implicit state machine via interactive commands, functions, and
;;  hooks.  Each game intrinsic implements this API to allow
;;  intersection amung game sources as we work with with them.

category, or frame of reference), and each :STATE FUN pair
represent a supported set pairing one of :extract :transform or
:load with a function, called with the parsed element (or with
point at the start of the unparsed element, in the case of
:extract with no prior state) followed by any prior state
information for the current workflow.  FUN may return NEW-STATE
to continue the workflow or nil to terminate it.

Prior state as well as NEW-STATE may either be a keyword symbol
or a con cell in the form:
