# logo image just floats left.  Github does a nicer job than htmlize
# so don't work about imaage overlapping first two text blocks in the
# HTML output; it is just for preview purposes.  Travis-ci makes the
# real .el and github creates the key documentation for review prior
# to download and install at which point prefer the help system.

* Obtaining Project Sources

The full compliment of available sources including documentation and
licensing information are not included within this file.

As noted in the package source:

#+name: attribution-and-source-pointer
#+begin_src org :tangle no :padline no
  This is the main distributable packaged from dungeon-mode `dm' sources
  and intended to support quick install and boot-strapping of an Emacs
  environment for game-play or authoring.  If you are packaging your
  own game (e.g. using `dm-publish') you may remove this paragraph but
  please retain the following one or include similar pointer back to an
  authoritative dungeon-mode repository (e.g. linking to your own fork
  is fine as people can eventually find reference to all contributions
  this way).

  Complete and authoritative source materials including issue reporting
  and status as well as additional documentary/narrative are available
  from our GitHub repository, which see:

*** dm-source

    Generic representation of game source.

    DATA may be at any level of abstraction.  In the context of
    `org-mode' this could mean a cell, row, or column within a table,
    an entire table, an hl with or without content and sub-sections,
    or the entire document.  Instance do not retain any association to
    their originating buffers or files -if any- which handling of is
    generally left to modes and otherwise the general behaviors of Emacs.

    DOCSTRING is documentation for the Dungeon Master to help
    use/apply and extend the source element. DOCSTRING defaults to the
    value or result of DATA when omitted and given DATA is a raw data
    value, expression, or function receiving no args.

    NARRATIVE is an additional doc-string suitable for display to
    players in tool-tips and built in help. E.g. Spoiler free help.
