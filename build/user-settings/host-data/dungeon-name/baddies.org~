baddies - they seem.. not nice.

Baddies is the general term for those which oppose you.  Some are
familiar others more mysterious.  Each player may keep separate notes
as secrets revealed, yours to keep even when no characters survive.

* Baddies                                                              :DATA:
  Organize baddies into tables and define them.  Reuse (yank) the
  definition using :ITEM=<name>:.  Clone (yank, except as noted) items
  using :CLONE=<name>:.  Give items easier to remember names with
  :NAME=<new-name>:.  Double-quote names containing spaces within
  tags.  See the Design section for column definitions.

** Chamber Tables
  These are the creatures in your dungeon crawl...

*** Chamber: Table 1

| Name           | ix | a/ix | b/ab | bh | x on y for z | sp | sw | ax | mace |
| Baby Sun-bears | 10 |      |      |    |              |    |    |    |      |

*** Chamber: Table 2

* Design
  Baddies form multiple top level tables.  Information is secret with
  some details exposed during game play.

#+begin_src elisp
  (dm-deftable baddies ((name             string       :tag "Name")
